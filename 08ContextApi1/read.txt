Context:
------------
When the data(props) required to a certain component is handled by each layer of their parent component
Here we manage the states in many unwanted components as well


steps:
-----------
- Create a Context variable(Here UserContext.js)
    As we created this (global)context, it will provide a ContextProvider.
    This Provider will be used as a wrapper to all the components.
    All the components wrapped in will get the access of the global context.
